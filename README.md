# FourTwentySeven, a mock up of the FiveThirtyEight website layout

See the site live [here](https://ubercj.github.io/four-twenty-seven/).

This is part of the final project for the CSS portion of The Odin Project's full-stack web development curriculum. Read more about the project [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-your-own-grid-based-framework).

The first part of the project was creating my own [grid-based CSS framework](https://github.com/ubercj/grid-based-framework). In this second part, I use my framework to create a mock-up of a website of my choosing. I chose one of my favorite sites to imitate, [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/).

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with how easy it was to use my framework. It was easy to layer on new styles on top of the framework stylesheet. There were a few "feature" that I was really missing from my framework, though - in particular classes to allow you to easily hide/display elements based on the screen size. Partly because of this, I ended up having to create some pretty elaborate media queries. I also could have included some more basic styling for common elements like links and buttons.

Ultimately, I wasn't setting out to recreate Bootstrap or anything, so I'm satisfied with what I came up with. Creating the layout was _a lot_ faster with the framework. And I still stand by the decision to make it fairly barebones so it can be customized easily.
